Hello!
to set process vars in node use:
USER_ID=239482 USER_KEY=foobar node app.js


todo:

- on move only redraw tiles and their objects that need redraw
- write map functions that can update only parts of the data (e.g. players)
- keep move clientside and only update map for other players when the
player have played enough move points from cards
    - if he fails to play the cards revert map (again clientside only)

- play plays card with id of 1 and this translates to game method playCard1 with its own implementation
    - which adds move points to a player
    - or attack
    - or player abilities for a particular game phase
        - or until the end of turn ..etc.

- double click a card from the hand of a player plays it
- double click of a card from the played cards area reverts the card

- players should become objects with fields, not just usernames
- give map tiles terain info

done:
